                    Basket.je is a price comparison website that I built from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's purpose is to aid consumers in saving money by making it easy to compare grocery prices across
                    various local retailers. To make this possible, I created a system for effortlessly collectng prices
                    using your smartphone while in the shop. I have also developed a native app using React Native that
                    is
                    yet to be released.
                </p>

                    <h3>The story</h3>

                    <h4>1. Starting out</h4>
                    <p>
                        I decided to start the project because I wasn't happy with the (now-defunct) PriceComparison.je
                        website. It lacked a lot of features, compared to a UK alternative such as <a
                            href="https://trolley.co.uk">Trolley.co.uk</a>,
                        and I wanted to do better for the island.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started by tacking the issue of price collection. As we all know, online grocery shopping is
                        virtually non existant in Jersey, save for Co-op and Orderit, so web scraping was out of the
                        question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had contacted a few retailers asking about obtaining the necessary price information, but did
                        not receive a reply. I decided the best way forward would be to develop an efficient solution of
                        collecting
                        prices on foot. I begun developing a mobile app using React Native, but quickly realised this
                        wasn't the most effective solution and pivoted towards a web based app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent a month or two developing and improving the site, adding new functionality and fixing
                        issues. It was then I got contacted by a UK company who was looking to do the same thing as I.
                        As I had already
                        completed a large chunk of the work myself, they offered a partnership. I accepted.
                    </p>

                    <h4>2. Partership</h4>
                    <p>
                        We worked together for a few months. I would develop the site and they would work on the
                        business side of things, however it never really went anywhere, due to them being based in the
                        UK and I being the sole person working on things over here. Thus, we decided to part ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm very greatful for their initial interest and continuous support, I probably wouldn't have
                        continued working on Basket.je if it wasn't for them.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3. Current state of affairs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, I don't really update the site. I haven't got the time to do this alone and would need at least 1-2 other people to help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As previously mentioned, PriceComparison.je was shut down, but it has been replaced with <a href="https://prices.je">Prices.je</a>.
                        Still not great. I have offered the site to the Jersey Consumer Council for free, but they are committed to Prices.je.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here is the page I used to update prices (Yes, it needs some styling improvements):
                    </p>
                    <img id="img-1" src="/images/projects/basketje/price-updater-1.png">
                    <p>Also, at the top of the page there is more options available, such as:</p>
                    <ul id="feature-list">
                        <li>Showing links to the product page (used for co-op so prices can be checked at a PC)</li>
                        <li>Show the product ID (used for testing mostly)</li>
                        <li>Choose which aisles you want to see</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Click on a product to see the below:</p>
                    <img id="img-2" src="/images/projects/basketje/price-updater-2.png">

                    <p>When I'm done, I'll hit submit at the top and select the location I was at (e.g. Iceland Parade).
                        Later, when we're at a PC, we find the request we just submitted:</p>
                    <img id="img-3" src="/images/projects/basketje/price-updater-3.png">
                    <p>(Again, could do with some styling improvements - this is probably one of the oldest pages on the
                        site)</p>
                    <p>Here we can download the data as a spreadsheet and make the necessary checks and changes before
                        re-uploading and making the data live on the site.</p>
                </div>
